<h1>üööüó∫Ô∏è TSP Branch & Bound ‚Äî Optimal Route Solver</h1>

<p>A High-Performance C++ Toolkit that finds optimal tours for classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem" target="_blank">Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)</a> instances.</br>
The project contains parallelized <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_and_bound" target="_blank">Branch-And-Bound (B&B)</a> implementations,
tested on <a href="https://www.grid5000.fr/w/Grid5000:Home" target="_blank">Grid5000's</a> <b><i>multi-core</b></i> and <b><i>multi-node</b></i> architectures, as well as parallelized implementations of <a href="https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/concorde.html" target="_blank">Concorde TSP Solver</a>.</p>

## üéØ Goals
This toolkit aims to find exact solutions to [tsplib](https://github.com/mastqe/tsplib) TSPs for an undirected graph with symmetric edge costs in three ways:
- Parallelizing Concorde on a multi-node architecture
- Implementing an [OpenMP](https://www.openmp.org/) suitable Branch and Bound approach for multi-core architectures.
- Swapping the default single-threaded LP solver that Concorde uses ([QSOPT](https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~bico/qsopt/)) with the multi-threaded [CPLEX](https://www.ibm.com/products/ilog-cplex-optimization-studio)
- Benchmark and record solving times of different implementations in various scenarios

## üóÇÔ∏è Custom Implementations
- **BaseRec.cpp** ‚Äì Base recursive implementation of Branch and Bound algorithm
- **ImprovedRec.cpp** ‚Äì Implemented ***Bitmasking*** and a more suitable ***lower bound***
- **BaseOpenMP.cpp** ‚Äì Achieved multiple core ***parallelization via OpenMP***
- **run_parallel.sh** ‚Äì ***Parralelizes Concorde*** on multiple available nodes with different seeds and then lists each node's performance time
- **run_parallel_best.sh** ‚Äì Also fires up multiple Concorde runs, but ***frees resources*** immediately after one node finishes (the fastest one)
